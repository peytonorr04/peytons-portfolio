        <h2>About The Project</h2>
        <div class="about-card">
        <p>
           Makapo Aquatics is an adaptive paddling organization supporting athletes with visual impairments. 
           Our team created a full pipeline that collects paddle stroke data from IoT sensors, processes it 
           through a central data hub, and delivers meaningful insights to coaches through a user-friendly app 
           interface.  The system captures live training data from prototype sensor units mounted on the paddles. This data is transmitted through a secure
            broker to our Makapo Data Hub, which parses, cleans, and formats the information before sending  
            it to the mobile-friendly coaching dashboard. Coaches can then analyze athlete performance, track
             consistency, and give real-time feedback during practice sessions.
