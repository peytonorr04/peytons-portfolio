                <p class="about-text">
                    I am a Computer Science student at Cal State LA with experience in full-stack development, 
                    distributed systems, and data-driven engineering. I currently serve as the Project Manager 
                    and Lead Developer for a senior design team partnered with Makapo Aquatics, where I oversee 
                    IoT sensor integration, backend processing, and frontend visualization for a real-time 
                    paddling analytics platform. My work spans Unity game development, scalable backend systems, 
                    and human-centered UI design. I enjoy building projects from concept to deployment and using 
                    software engineering principles to solve meaningful,real-world problems.
